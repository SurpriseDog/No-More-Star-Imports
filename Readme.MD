SurpriseDog presents scripts to help you tame those fobidden wildcard * imports:


----


Star Namer will go through a list of wildcard * imports for a script and replace them with the actual functions to be imported.

	For example: from common import *

	will become: from common import fuction1, function2, function3...

Usage: ./star_namer.py module_filename script_filename

Example: ./star_name.py common.py script_name.py


----


Star Wrangler will go through the list of those imported functions and generate a .py file containing all of the functions code used and do so in the correct order. Then it will examine each function individually so that any depencies are also copied over. Finally a list of necessary imports are generated at the top.

Look at sd/common.py for an example of this. A code file generated by this very script. If you have multiple modules to copy from, then you can do what I do and create a module called "common" with a bunch of "from mod_name import *..." to tie together multiple modules in one group.

The way this works is that each section of code is examined with pylint to see if there are any undefined functions, then it compares that list with the list of all functions in the target module. Make sure pylint is installed before use: https://www.pylint.org/#install

You can edit the shared.py variables to correct the installation path to pylint. This is necessary, because python's environmental variables can lead to running with older pylint installs are weird bugs. Here, you can also set a custom header and footer for the files generated by star_wrangler.py

Usage: ./star_wrangler.py module_filename script 1 script 2 ...

from_to_import.py can convert a script with: "from modname import function" to "import modname"

For example:

    from universe import function
    ...
    ...
    ...
    function()


becomes:

    import universe
    ...
    ...
    ...
    universe.function()


Usage: from_to_import.py script_name modname
